    "# Structured vs. Non-Structured Financial Products\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial products can broadly be divided into **non-structured (plain-vanilla)** and **structured** instruments.\n",
    "The core distinction is **not legal form**, but **how the payoff is engineered** and **which risks the investor ultimately bears**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-structured products offer **direct, linear exposure** to an asset or issuer, such as common stocks.\n",
    "Structured products, by contrast, embed **derivatives and conditional logic** to reshape risk and return into predefined payoff profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "This distinction is fundamental to understanding products such as **MTNs, structured notes, warrants, certificates, buffers, and barriers**.\n",

    "## Non-Structured Financial Products (Plain-Vanilla)\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-structured products are securities with a **transparent, linear payoff** directly linked to **ownership or lending**, without embedded derivatives or payoff conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Typical Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "* Common stock\n",
    "* Preferred stock\n",
    "* Corporate bonds\n",
    "* Treasuries\n",
    "* Plain ETFs and mutual funds\n",
    "* Straight convertibles (borderline but largely linear)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Payoff Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stock**: gains and losses move 1:1 with price changes\n",
    "* **Bond**: fixed coupons plus principal repayment, subject to credit risk\n",

    "## Structured Financial Products\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured financial products are **engineered investment securities** whose payoff is determined by a **pre-defined formula**, typically involving **embedded derivatives** and **non-linear or conditional outcomes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than providing direct exposure, they **synthetically construct** a desired payoff profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Building Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fixed Income Component (Safe Leg)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * This is typically the foundation of the product, making up the majority of the invested capital (often **80–95%**).\n",
    "   * **Zero-Coupon Bond:** The most common instrument used. The issuer buys a bond at a deep discount that matures at \"par\" ($100\\%$ of principal) at the end of the term.\n",
    "   * This component is responsible for the **capital protection** feature. Even if the market side of the trade fails, the bond's growth back to its face value ensures the investor receives their invested capital back (subject to the issuer's credit risk).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Derivative Component (Kicker)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The money saved by buying the bond at a discount (the remaining **5–20%**) is used to purchase derivatives.\n",
    "   * **Options:** Usually options (**call**, **put**, or combinations) are employed to create the desired payoff structure.\n",
    "      * **Call Options:** Provide \"Upside Participation,\" allowing the investor to profit if an index or stock rises.\n",
    "      * **Put Options:** Often *sold* by the investor (embedded in the structure) to generate \"yield enhancement\" (coupons), in exchange for taking the risk that the principal might not be protected if the market crashes below a certain level.\n",
    "   * This part defines the **payoff profile**. It determines whether the product is for growth, income (coupons), or speculation. It defines how the investor participates in market movements, i.e. upside participation, neutral, or downside exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Underlying Asset (Reference)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The performance of the structured product is linked to an underlying asset or index. Common underlyings include:\n",
    "      * Equity indices (S&P 500, NASDAQ-100)\n",
    "      * Single stocks\n",
    "      * Commodities\n",
    "      * FX rates\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Typical Structured Products\n",
    "\n",
    "* Structured notes\n",
    "* Equity-linked notes\n",
    "* Autocallables\n",
    "* Reverse convertibles\n",
    "* Barrier notes\n",
    "* Principal-protected notes\n",
    "* Range accrual notes\n",
    "* Buffered or capped notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Payoff Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of structured payoff logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pays 8% unless the index falls below 70% of its initial level\n",
    "* Calls early if the index is at or above its start level on an observation date\n",
    "* Caps upside in exchange for a downside buffer\n",
    "\n",
    "These outcomes are implemented through **embedded option positions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Modification Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured products are fine-tuned using modifiers such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Caps**: limit maximum return\n",
    "* **Barriers**: activate or deactivate protection or losses\n",
    "* **Participation rates**: scale exposure to the underlying’s performance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical note:**\n",
    "Because the safe leg is a bond, investors are exposed to **issuer credit risk**. Even \"capital-protected\" products fail if the issuing bank defaults.\n"

    "## Example 1: 5-Year Capital Protected Note\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how a structured product works in practice, we look at a classic example: a **5-Year Capital Protected Note** linked to the S&P 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine an investment of **$10,000** into such a **5-Year Capital Protected Note**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Ingredients\n",
    "\n",
    "The bank splits the $10,000 into two unequal pieces:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Shield ($8,500):** They buy a 5-year zero-coupon bond. Because of the \"time value of money,\" this $8,500 is guaranteed to grow back to exactly **$10,000** in five years (provided the bank doesn't go bankrupt).\n",
    "* **The Engine ($1,500):** They take the remaining cash and buy a **call option** on the S&P 500. This is a bet that the market will be higher in five years than it is today.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Possible Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "After five years, only two things can happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario A: The Market Roars (Bull Market)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The S&P 500 is up 40%.\n",
    "* The **Shield** has matured to $10,000.\n",
    "* The **Engine** (the option) is now very valuable. The bank pays out a portion of that 40% gain.\n",
    "* **Result:** $10,000 paid back + profit on the option (= $13,000 total).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario B: The Market Crashes (Bear Market)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The S&P 500 is down 30%.\n",
    "* The **Engine** (the option) expires worthless.\n",
    "* However, the **Shield** has still matured to $10,000.\n",
    "* **Result:** $10,000 paid back, no profit. The investor lost the *opportunity* to earn a return, but the original investment is intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The \"Fine Print\"\n",
    "\n",
    "While this sounds like a \"no-lose\" situation, there are three hidden factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Caps & Participation:** The bank might say, \"We will pay out the upside, but only up to a maximum of 25%.\" That's how they pay for the protection.\n",
    "2.  **No Dividends:** The investor usually only gets the price return of the index. The bank keeps the dividends to help pay for the structure.\n",
    "3.  **Credit Risk:** If the bank fails, the \"Shield\" disappears. The investor is an unsecured creditor of that bank."

    "## Example 2: 2-Year Autocallable Note\n",
    "\n",
    "An **Autocallable Note** is a common \"yield enhancement\" product. While a Capital Protected Note is a bet on **growth**, the Autocallable is a bet on **stability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine an investment of $\\$10,000$ into a **2-Year Autocallable Note**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Ingredients\n",

    "The bank splits the $\\$10,000$ into two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Shield ($9,000):** The bank buys a bond to ensure it has the cash to pay back the initial investment.\n",
    "* **The Generator ($1,000):** The investor **sells a Put Option on the S&P 500** to the bank, i.e. the bank buys a put option from the investor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Logic:** The investor will take the risk that the S&P 500 crashes by more than 30%. In exchange for taking that risk, the investor receives \"rent\" payments (=coupon) of 10% (= $\\$1,000$) per year from the bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Possible Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "This note has \"Observation Dates\" (e.g., every 6 months). At each date, the bank looks at the S&P 500:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scenario A: The Early Exit (Market is Up/Flat)**\n",
    "    If the S&P 500 is at or above its starting level on an observation date, the note is **\"called\"** (it ends early).\n",
    "    * **Result:** Get $\\$10,000$ back, plus $10\\%$ coupon. The trade is over.\n",
    "* **Scenario B: The Steady Pay (Market is Slightly Down)**\n",
    "    If the S&P 500 is down $10\\%$, it's not \"called,\" so the trade continues. As long as it stays above a certain \"Coupon Barrier\" (e.g., $-20\\%$), the investor keeps receiving $10\\%$ (= $\\$1,000$) annual pay.\n",
    "* **Scenario C: The Crash (Market is Way Down)**\n",
    "    If the S&P 500 drops $40\\%$ and stays there until the end of the 2 years, the investor hits the **\"Knock-in Barrier.\"**\n",
    "    * **Result:** The protection \"knocks out.\". The principal is lost 1-for-1 with the market. If the index is down $40\\%$, the investor only gets back **$\\$6,000$**.\n",
