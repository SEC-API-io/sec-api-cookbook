    "A **Business Development Company (BDC)** is an investment company that raises capital from investors to finance small and mid-sized, often privately held, U.S. businesses. In addition to providing capital, BDCs are required to offer **managerial assistance** to their portfolio companies, typically through strategic guidance, operational support, or financial advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Created by Congress in **1980** under the **Small Business Investment Incentive Act**, BDCs operate under **Sections 55–65 of the Investment Company Act of 1940** (\"'40 Act\") to promote the flow of private capital to developing American enterprises. A company becomes a BDC by filing **Form N-54A** with the SEC and may later withdraw that election through **Form N-54C**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Legally, a BDC is a closed-end management investment company regulated by the SEC. It functions much like an investment fund, raising capital to invest in a portfolio of private loans and equity, but operates under a distinct framework with additional regulatory constraints."

    "* **Leverage rules differ:** BDCs can operate with **150% asset-coverage** (ie, 2:1 debt-to-equity) if approved and disclosed, reduced from the historical 200% by the **Small Business Credit Availability Act (2018)**.\n",
    "* **Liquidity for investors:** many BDCs are exchange-listed; others are **non-traded** (illiquid, interval-style liquidity, and often higher fees).\n",
